### Things learnt:
- CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for integrating applications. CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

- Axios
Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

- Proxying API Requests
A proxy is something that acts on behalf of something else. Sitting between your application and your backend, API proxies provide an interface to developers for accessing backend services.
